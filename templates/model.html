            In the past few decades, Deep Learning has proved to be a very
            powerful tool because of its ability to handle large amounts of
            data. The interest to use hidden layers has surpassed traditional
            techniques, especially in pattern recognition. One of the most
            popular deep neural networks is Convolutional Neural Networks.

        <h1>About Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</h1>
        Since the 1950s, the early days of AI, researchers have struggled to
        make a system that can understand visual data. In the following years,
        this field came to be known as Computer Vision. In 2012, computer vision
        took a quantum leap when a group of researchers from the University of
        Toronto developed an AI model that surpassed the best image recognition
        algorithms and that too by a large margin. The AI system, which became
        known as AlexNet (named after its main creator, Alex Krizhevsky), won
        the 2012 ImageNet computer vision contest with an amazing 85 percent
        accuracy. The runner-up scored a modest 74 percent on the test. At the
        heart of AlexNet was Convolutional Neural Networks a special type of
        neural network that roughly imitates human vision. Over the years CNNs
        have become a very important part of many Computer Vision applications
        and hence a part of any computer vision course online. So letâ€™s take a
        look at the workings of CNNs.

        <h1>How accurate this model is?</h1>
        During training and validation the accuracy of this model came out to be
        approx 98%.

          >But we still advice you to contact with a doctor/medical expert as
          this model is not 100% accurate.</b
